The test assignment on position Senior/Lead C++ Developer at Luxoft includes two problems:

* Use two threads to increment an integer. Thread A increments when even and Thread B increments when odd (for the integer problem we can have it specify up to a number provided on the command line).
    * What are some of the difficulties in adding more threads? Please show the difficulties with code
    * Extra credit - Design an improved solution to the above that can scale with many threads
* Knight's tour - Please improve on the Knight's tour problem by improving scalability. Feel free to start with any example that can be found online.
